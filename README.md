# Player-1-SNES-Input-Tracker
An input tracker for an SNES controller built in Unity (currently built for Linux only)

Version 0.0.1

The current build of this tracker only works on Linux systems and still has a few bugs.  The controller needs to have already been plugged in when the application starts, and removing the controller will require a restart of the application.
