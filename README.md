# Player-1-SNES-Input-Tracker
An input tracker for an SNES controller built in Unity (currently built for Linux only)

2019-07-29: Version 1.0.0
The tracker now has support for keyboard input and can support multiple controllers.  All known bugs have been corrected in the software, including but not limited to:

  * Better axis handling for joysticks and d-pads alike.
  * Recognition of controllers when plugged in at any time, rather than requiring the controller to already be plugged in.

Version 0.0.1

The current build of this tracker only works on Linux systems and still has a few bugs.  The controller needs to have already been plugged in when the application starts, and removing the controller will require a restart of the application.
